VRGK (Virtual Reality Game Kit) is a very useful VR template for Unreal Engine. It is full of amazing scripts, physics systems and demo blueprints. You can easily develop a lot of amazing VR games with this template.

It is available for Unreal Engine 4.25, 4.26 and 4.27. Although so, I had converted it to 5.1 a few months ago and it worked like a charm. I might add a converted 5.x version in the future.

Do enjoy using this repository as you like.
