# VIRTUAL REALITY GAME KIT FOR UNREAL ENGINE 4

# DISCLAIMER: I AM NOT THE DEVELOPER OF VRGK. 
I'm only adding this repository because all versions of VRGK are discontinued and are no longer sold, and I think people should be able to use this beautiful kit for their games.

VRGK (Virtual Reality Game Kit) is a very useful VR template for Unreal Engine. It is full of amazing scripts, physics systems and demo blueprints. You can easily develop a lot of amazing VR games with this template.

It is available for Unreal Engine 4.25, 4.26 and 4.27. Although so, since I had converted it to 5.1 a few months ago and it worked like a charm, I've now converted it to 5.3 for public use. It is not yet tested, but it should work without problems. Do let me know if you encounter issues.

Do enjoy using this repository as you like.
